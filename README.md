# Description 
This repository explores the Fever Diagnosis and Medicine dataset, which contains detailed medical data for diagnosing fever severity and related factors. The project involves data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and the development of multiple machine learning models to predict outcomes with high accuracy. 

# Dataset 
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes features such as patient demographics, symptoms, lifestyle factors, and environmental conditions. These features were used to predict fever severity and provide insights into potential medicine recommendations.

# Project Workflow 
1. Data Preprocessing:
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling numerical features.

2. Dimensionality Reduction:
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset's dimensions while retaining critical information.

3. Modeling:
Developed and evaluated four machine learning models:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees

4. Evaluation:
All models performed exceptionally well, achieving accuracy between 0.80 and 0.99 on the test data.
